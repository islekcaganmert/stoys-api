# STOYS API

Reverse engineered API for Ubit STOYS

### Requirements

1. Python 3.9+
2. STOYS account

### Why?

Since the default UI is out-dated and Bahcesehir College has lots of student interested in software development, I want to see an alternative client, so I built an unofficial API for it. Also maybe this should teach the official developers of STOYS to take security seriously.
